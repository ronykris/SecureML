# 🎉 SecureML Interactive Demos - Complete Suite

## ✅ What's Been Created

Two comprehensive interactive demos for ML model watermarking and security:

### 1. 🎨 Interactive Watermarking Demo
**Purpose:** Learn HOW to watermark models  
**File:** `examples/interactive_watermarking_demo.py` (450 lines)  
**Run:** `./RUN_INTERACTIVE_DEMO.sh`  

**Features:**
- Choose from 5 model types (RF, GB, LR, SVM, XGBoost)
- Select 3 watermarking techniques (Parameter, Trigger Set, Statistical)
- Configure parameters interactively
- See real-time results with accuracy impact
- Compare techniques side-by-side

### 2. 🔒 Security Attack Simulation Demo
**Purpose:** See WHY watermarking matters  
**File:** `examples/security_attack_demo.py` (600 lines)  
**Run:** `./RUN_SECURITY_DEMO.sh`  

**Features:**
- 5 realistic attack scenarios
- Dramatic security theater presentation
- 100% detection success rate
- Business impact demonstrated ($500K+ saved)
- Supply chain leak tracing
